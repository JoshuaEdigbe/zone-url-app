# ShortLink

ShortLink is a URL shortening app where you enter a URL such as https://example.com
and it returns a short URL such as http://short.est/GeAi9K. Visiting a shortened URL should
redirect the user to the long URL. Using the example above, visiting http://short.est/GeAi9K
should redirect the user to https://example.com .
